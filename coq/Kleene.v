  (*
    Assumption: Let (T, leq) be a partially ordered set, or poset. A poset is
    a set with a binary relation which is reflexive, transitive, and
    antisymmetric.
  *)

  Parameter T : Set.
  Parameter leq : T -> T -> Prop.

  Axiom refl : forall x, leq x x.
  Axiom trans : forall x y z, leq x y -> leq y z -> leq x z.
  Axiom antisym : forall x y, leq x y -> leq y x -> x = y.

  Hint Resolve refl.
  Hint Resolve trans.
  Hint Resolve antisym.

  (*
    A supremum of a subset of T is a least element of T which is greater than
    or equal to every element in the subset. This is also called a join or
    least upper bound.
  *)

  Definition supremum P x1 :=
    (forall x2, P x2 -> leq x2 x1) /\
    forall x3, (forall x2, P x2 -> leq x2 x3) -> leq x1 x3.

  (*
    A directed subset of T is a non-empty subset of T such that any two
    elements in the subset have an upper bound in the subset.
  *)

  Definition directed P :=
    (exists x1, P x1) /\
    forall x1 x2, P x1 -> P x2 -> exists x3, leq x1 x3 /\ leq x2 x3 /\ P x3.

  (*
    Assumption: Let the partial order be directed-complete. That means every
    directed subset has a supremum.
  *)

  Axiom directedComplete :
    forall P,
    directed P ->
    exists x, supremum P x.

  Hint Resolve directedComplete.

  (*
    Assumption: Let T have a least element called bottom. This makes our
    partial order a pointed directed-complete partial order.
  *)

  Parameter bottom : T.

  Axiom bottomLeast : forall x, leq bottom x.

  Hint Resolve bottomLeast.

  (*
    A monotone function is one which preserves order. We only need to consider
    functions for which the domain and codomain are identical and have the same
    order relation, but this need not be the case for monotone functions in
    general.
  *)

  Definition monotone f := forall x1 x2, leq x1 x2 -> leq (f x1) (f x2).

  (*
    A function is Scott-continuous if it preserves suprema of directed subsets.
    We only need to consider functions for which the domain and codomain are
    identical and have the same order relation, but this need not be the case
    for continuous functions in general.
  *)

  Definition continuous (f : T -> T) :=
    forall P x1,
    directed P ->
    supremum P x1 ->
    supremum (fun x2 => exists x3, P x3 /\ x2 = f x3) (f x1).

  (* This function performs iterated application of a function to bottom. *)

  Fixpoint approx f n :=
    match n with
    | 0 => bottom
    | S n => f (approx f n)
    end.

  (*
    Iterated applications of a monotone function f to bottom form an ω-chain,
    which means they are a totally ordered subset of T. This ω-chain is called
    the ascending Kleene chain of f.
